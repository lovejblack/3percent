# 3percent
is an app for businesses and customers, facilitating currency exchange for services or goods.
a local bar downloads the app, creates a menu. a customer uses the app to order from their seat.
the bartender recieves the order, sends it with the server, the server drops it off and taps complete.
the customer then adds the tip for the order. 
the transaction is handled instantly, no paper reciepts, one click.
reduces the need for staffing overhead. 
goods and services are paid for up front.
the app is add free and takes 3 percent of each transaction.
3percent is easy to use, has a kick ass UI, and plenty of templates for each type of business.
the intention is to make payments instant, cut overhead and time, and be a single payment solution allowing anything to anything.
each vendor and customer can be verified by creating an uphold account.
